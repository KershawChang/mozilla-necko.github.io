## Highlights

* This is Dragana last week on Necko. We would all like to thank her for years of leadership and hard work and wish her only the best going forward.

## Project Updates

* Dragana and Kershaw have completed a big refactoring of [the proxy code](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1754731)
* Manuel has been working on 103 early hints
* Kershaw has written a great proposal of adding HTTP/2 and HTTP/3 support to mochitests. The team intends to work on it later this year.
* Sunil has fixed a [webcompat](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1697421) issue and will continue to work on improving our fetch web-platform test pass rate.
* Dragana and Kershaw have been working on [WebTransport](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1709355)
* Andrew Creskey from the Performance team has been adding probes [measuring network timings](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1777538) that are internal to Gecko. The results will be used to guide and prioritize performance optimizations.
* Ed has completed a cross-origin cookie broadcast fix and is working on fixing websockets over http2.
* Valentin added [test helpers](https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/source/netwerk/test/unit/head_servers.js) that spawn node instances for HTTP/S, HTTP/2 and proxy servers. These will help us to write unit tests faster.

## Below the fold

* Kagami has been fixing some problems with the [purgeHTTPCache background task](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1791675), which will allow us to enable it for beta and release channels. That will get rid of a lot of pesky windows shutdown hangs.
* John Schanck has helped us write a [Faulty TLS server](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1754746) that will allow us to write better tests for error conditions in networking code.
* Kershaw added a [new API in nsIRequest.idl](https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/rev/a64647a2125cf3d334451051491fef6772e8eb57/netwerk/base/nsIRequest.idl#209) to allow consumers of nsIRequest to provide the reason for cancellation. 
* ObliviousHTTP implementation is in-progress with Dana Keeler from NSS and support from Necko, targeting experimentation in 2023
* Paul Adenot [moved the logging section](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1347955) of about:networking to about:logging.
